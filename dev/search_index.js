In using this library the combination of a string identifier and the element symbol provides a unique and reproducible mapping to a pseudopotential file. Moreover in case the pseudopotential file happens to be missing on the computer Julia's artifact system takes care to automatically download it as needed.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Basic-usage","page":"Home","title":"Basic usage","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"For example, the following code automatically downloads the pseudopotential file of the stringent pseudodojo pseudopotential for LDA pseudopotentials (referred to by the identifier pd_nc_sr_lda_stringent_0.4.1_upf) and places the full path to the downloaded pseudopotential file into the filename variable:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"using PseudoLibraries\nidentifier = \"pd_nc_sr_lda_stringent_0.4.1_upf\"\nlibrary = PseudoLibrary(identifier)\nfilename = library[:Si]","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"As you see this will be a string such as /home/user/.julia/artifacts/56094b8162385233890d523c827ba06e07566079/Si.upf, which luckily you don't usually have to know or remember. Note, further that this path may differ between computers, julia versions etc. It is therefore highly recommended to use the above mechanism based on identfier and element symbol instead of hard-coding the expanded path in user scripts.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"An alternative version to achieve the same thing as above is","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"filename = pseudofile(library, :Si)","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"or for multiple elements:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"pseudofile.(library, [:C, :Si])","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Some metadata information is stored in the library object:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"library","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"For a list of available identifiers see","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"PseudoLibraries.available_identifiers()","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"More details on the meaning of these keys is given in the README of thei PseudoLibrary repository.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"warning: Rename of pseudopotential identifier reserved\nThe current identifiers for the pseudopotential families is planned to be overhauled.
